### This is the program that handles the mission and interactions for the Tello drone. ###

### Program description ###
The program will read and load resnet into a torchvision model file, already pretrained on fire/nonfire pictures.
The program will connect to the drone using an UDP connection and a specific port reserved for this.
The drone will take off, take 4 pictures in each direction (forward, backward, left, right). 
The leaded torchvision model evalates the pictures, depending if it's fire or not.
If there's a fire showing up on any of the photos, the drone will send notification to a specified group of people.
Notification sending works by commanding a previously defined telegram bot controlled by HTTP requests. 
Important: the Telegram bot needs to be activated for the user. --> Verify by sending a message to Wedsbot
For connection with wifi settings refer to wifitest.py

### Changelog ###
Added customizable mission to program e.g. mission library. Now controllable by hyperparams.
Added switching between automatic and manual control modes.
New mission added: drone can be controlled with pygame.
When mission is over the interface will connect to the net defined in params and send out notifications
